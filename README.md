# tactip-online-learning
Control and analysis code for online learning (also know as continual learning) experiments with the tactip tactile sensor, used in my PhD research.

This code is intended to work with a [Dobot Magician](https://www.dobot-robots.com/products/education/magician.html) robot arm and a [TacTip](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/tactip) tactile sensor (designed and tested with the [TacFoot](https://github.com/Tebazil12/TacFoot) variant only so far) controlled through Ubuntu (not tested on Windows, but it should work). This code replicates and extends the [original code](https://github.com/Tebazil12/phd-arm-code) which was writen in MatLab for use on a Windows machine controlling an ABB industrial arm with a standard TacTip. 

Prerequisites: Common Robot Interface [(cri)](https://github.com/jlloyd237/cri) and Video Stream Processor [(vsp)](https://github.com/jlloyd237/vsp) libraries  

(this code needs tidying and is currently not in a pretty state for anyone else to use, but it might be interesting to look at so here it is)
